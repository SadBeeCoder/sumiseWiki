    <h2><span class="bold"> About RPGs </span></h2>
    <p>
        Role-playing games (RPGs) are interactive narratives where participants assume fictional roles within a defined
        setting. Players create characters with unique traits, skills, and backgrounds, and make decisions that impact
        the unfolding story. Guided by rules and mechanics, RPGs blend storytelling and gameplay, allowing players to
        engage in dialogue, combat, and exploration. Dice rolls often determine outcomes, adding an element of chance to
        actions. RPGs can span various genres, from fantasy and science fiction to historical and horror. They emphasize
        collaboration, creativity, and immersion, offering players a chance to experience adventures through the eyes of
        their characters.

    <h2><span class="bold"> History of RPGs </span></h2>
    <p>
        Role-playing games (RPGs) emerged in the 1970s as a fusion of tabletop wargaming and storytelling. Gary Gygax
        and Dave Arneson's "Dungeons & Dragons" (D&D) introduced the genre in 1974, allowing players to inhabit fantasy
        characters and explore imaginative worlds. The 1980s saw the rise of more diverse RPGs, like "Traveller" and
        "Call of Cthulhu," each with distinct settings and mechanics. The transition to computer RPGs occurred in the
        late 1970s and 1980s with titles like "Wizardry" and "Ultima." The 1990s brought iconic computer RPGs like
        "Baldur's Gate" and "Final Fantasy VII," showcasing deep narratives and evolving gameplay. Massively multiplayer
        online RPGs (MMORPGs) like "Ultima Online" and "EverQuest" gained popularity in the late 1990s, creating virtual
        worlds for thousands to explore simultaneously. Modern RPGs continue to thrive across tabletop and digital
        platforms, offering rich storytelling, complex character development, and immersive experiences.
