      "Call of Cthulhu" is a tabletop role-playing game (RPG)
        based on the works of the famous horror author H.P. Lovecraft. In this dark and
        atmospheric game, players take on the roles of investigators who confront
        mysterious and often supernatural secrets and conspiracies. The game world is
        characterized by cosmic horror, where the boundary between reality and madness
        blurs. Players solve puzzles, investigate unexplained incidents, and encounter
        terrifying creatures from another dimension. The focus is on a grim atmosphere,
        a deep narrative, and the challenge of maintaining one's own mental health
        while confronting the abyss of the unknown. "Call of Cthulhu" provides an
        intense and unique role-playing experience that immerses players in a world of
        horror and mysteries.</p>


    <h3 class="textheader1 "> Rulesystem </h3>
    <p class="infotext1 ">The rules system of "Call of Cthulhu" is designed to immerse
        players in a world of mystery and horror, reflecting the themes of Lovecraftian
        cosmic dread. The game uses a percentile-based system, where characters' abilities
        and skills are represented by percentile values. When attempting actions, players
        roll percentile dice to determine success or failure, with higher values indicating
        better performance.

        Characters' skills and attributes are defined by a wide range of characteristics,
        such as Strength, Dexterity, Intelligence, and specialized skills like Investigation,
        Occult, and Firearms. As the game emphasizes investigation and storytelling,
        combat is often deadly and discouraged, reinforcing the idea that knowledge and
        cautious exploration are key to survival.

        One unique feature of the game is the Sanity mechanic. Characters are exposed to
        horrific and otherworldly experiences, and as they witness the unimaginable, their
        sanity can deteriorate. The game master (Keeper) carefully tracks and assigns
        sanity points, and when a character's sanity erodes, it can result in temporary or
        permanent mental conditions, affecting gameplay and role-playing.

        "Call of Cthulhu" encourages immersive storytelling and focuses on narrative-driven
        gameplay. It allows players to delve into the psychological and emotional aspects
        of their characters, bringing out the fear and vulnerability that comes with
        confronting the unknown. This rules system creates an atmosphere of tension and
        suspense, making each decision and action a critical one as investigators strive to
        uncover the secrets lurking in the shadows.</p>
